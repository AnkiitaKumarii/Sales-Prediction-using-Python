Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uniabhi/bigmart-sales-data

I have have downloaded the dataset of Big Mart Sales from kaggle.

In this I have performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data.The following information I have gained:

•	In the year 1985 maximum numbers of shops has been established.

•	Fruits,vegetables and snacks food are having more sales compare to other products.

•	Small size of shops are having more sales compare to medium and large.

•	Super Market Type-1 is having more sales.

I have used two machine learning algorithms to create the model:

•	Linaer Regression

•	Random Forest
